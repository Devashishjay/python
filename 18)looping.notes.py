# <!-- looping:-
# looping is a phenomena where we do same set of instructions again and agian until and unless the condition become false

# we have two types of looping
# 1)while loop
# 2)forloop

# while=in while loop we do same set of instructions again and again until and unless the condition become false
#     -in while loop first we have to insilation.
#     -then write a condition as per your requirement.
#     -to run the loop used uptation(increament/decreament)[updation means loop ko chalana]
#     -while loop is a infinite looping entity
